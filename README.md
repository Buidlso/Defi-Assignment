# Frontend Assignment: DeFi DApp Development

## Objective:
Develop a DeFi application that provides robust features for wallet connectivity, token swapping, and real-time visualization of cryptocurrency prices.


## Required Functionalities:

- ### Wallet Connection:
    Construct a UI component leveraging Web3 modal libraries to interface with Ethereum wallets via MetaMask or WalletConnect. This includes auto-detection of wallet presence, secure session establishment, and error management.

- ### Cryptocurrency Price Charting:
    Utilize the Recharts library to construct interactive charts that display real-time price data of cryptocurrencies. Implement data fetching from sources like CoinGecko or CryptoCompare.

- ### Token Swapping Mechanism:
    Integrate a decentralized exchange protocol API (such as 0x or Bungee) to enable ERC-20 token swaps directly within the application. The functionality should include fetching and rendering dynamic exchange pair data, managing ERC-20 token approvals, executing swap transactions, and handling blockchain interactions with transaction signing.

## Tech Stack: 
    NextJS, Typescript, Recharts, TailwindCSS.


## Technical Deliverables:

- A deployed prototype demonstrating the integration of wallet connectivity, on-chain token swapping, and live data charting
- Source code repository on GitHub with README for setup, and operational guidance.


Good Luck!!
